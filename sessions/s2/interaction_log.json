    "query": "why did lencho's crops failed?",
    "response": " Lencho's crops failed due to a hailstorm. The big drops were ten cent pieces and the little ones were fives, which suggests a heavy rain. However, suddenly a strong wind began to blow, covered with cloth, and along with the rain, very large hailstones began to fall, resembling new silver coins. These hailstones destroyed Lencho's fields, leaving nothing but a white field covered with salt, and no leaves on the trees. The corn was totally destroyed, and the flowers were gone from the locust plants. This event filled Lencho with sadness, as he realized this meant they would have no corn for the year."

    "query": "was the post man good in nature?",
    "response": " 1. Lencho has complete faith in God. Sentences that tell you this are: \"The following Sunday, at daybreak, he began to write a letter which he himself would carry to town and place in the mail. It was nothing less than a letter to God.\" and \"Lencho was an ox of a conscience man, working like an animal in the fields, but still an inner sense of right and wrong he knew how to write.\"\n\n2. The postman and the postmaster read the letter.\n\n3. The postmaster decided to answer the letter by gathering money to send to Lencho. He signed the letter with 'God' as a signature.\n\n4. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him. He thought it was God who had sent the money.\n\n5. The irony in the situation is that Lencho accuses the post office employees of being crooks, when it was actually the postmaster who had secretly sent the money.\n\n6. The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated through the hailstorm that destroyed Lencho's crops. The conflict between humans themselves is illustrated through the postmaster's deception of Lencho.\n\n7. Lencho can be described as unquestioning.\n\n8. The hailstorm is a form of conflict between humans and nature. The postmaster's deception of Lencho is a form of conflict between humans themselves.\n\n9. gale - A strong wind; whirlwind - A spinning column of air; cyclone - A large storm with winds spinning around a center; hurricane - A large storm with winds spinning around a center, especially in the Atlantic Ocean; tornado - A violent storm with a spinning column of air; typhoon - A large storm with winds spinning around a center, especially in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n10.
